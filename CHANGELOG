  - Added component.defer(operation).until(object,trigger) as wrapper around .once binding.
    operation can be a string, or a function, and the call to until accepts an object and
    the name of a trigger to listen for on that object.  if you just pass a trigger, object is implicitly the component
  - Luca() is now a global helper for finding views, querying the cache, lazily creating objects, etc.  smart enough
    to know what you want from it based on the input
