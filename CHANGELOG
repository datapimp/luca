  - Fixes style conflicts for Bootstrap grid-* css selectors
  - Adds getForm() and getModel() methods to Luca.Field classes that belong to a form

0.8.5
  - Luca.define() can be used to extend components, and retain references
    to the inheritance chain.  Components defined this way will have
    _className attributes as well as _superClass() references.  This
    allows for introspection of components as well as advanced
    querying of the Luca Component Cache

  _ Added _.def as an alias to Luca.define

  - All Luca components have been migrated over to the new Luca.define() API

0.8.6
  - Luca.ModalView has been refactored to use Twitter Bootstrap Modal
  - Luca.Application now has keyEvents API for handling keypress
    events and delegating them properly
  - Luca.containers.CardView has been refactored to be more inline with base container
  - Luca.View gets $append, $html, $container jQuery helpers.  shortcut for @renderToEl().append, etc
  - Luca.View gets @bodyTagName, @bodyTemplate properties.
      - @bodyTemplate references a JST template which automatically gets added
      via $html if present, immediately when the view is rendered
      - @bodyTagName is where $append, $html will insert content, otherwise defaults to @$el
  - Luca.View has $bodyEl() method which points to $(@bodyTagName) or $(@el) ( default )

0.8.7
  - Luca.core.Container now uses bodyTemplate to render
  - Luca.Collection.cached property is now deprecated.  use @cache_key instead
  - introducing Luca.Collection.cachedMethods property.  any method on the
    collection which is listed here, will have its return value memoized upon
    first being called.  Whenever the collection is reset or changed, this
    value will be cleared, and then the next call will be cached, and so on

0.8.8
  - Added development mode helpers to Luca.View to aid in browser editing
  - Added configuration for @deferrable rendering system for Luca.View
  - Added isComponent and supportsBackboneEvents helpers
  - Added componentEvents configuration sugar to Luca.core.Container classes
    @componentEvents allows for a container to bind to events on its children
  - major work on component tester
  - the development console component now extends from Luca.core.Panel instead of the ModalView
  - Added _super() method which accepts a method name, context, and arguments array
    and is the equivalent to applying the component you extend from prototype method
    with @, arguments
  - Added component.once, as an alias for binding to an event and firing a callback one time
  - Added component.defer(operation).until(object,trigger) as wrapper around .once binding.
    operation can be a string, or a function, and the call to until accepts an object and
    the name of a trigger to listen for on that object.  if you just pass a trigger, object is implicitly the component
  - Luca() is now a global helper for finding views, querying the cache, lazily creating objects, etc.  smart enough
    to know what you want from it based on the input
  - window.Luca now mixes in Backbone.Events and Luca.Events.  triggers events whenever components are registered or created

0.8.9

  - Refactored GridView and FormView to inherit from Luca.components.Panel
