# Luca.Collection
#
# Luca.Collection is an extenstion of Backbone.Collection which provides
# a bunch of commonly used patterns for doing things like:
#
#   - setting base parameters used on every request to your REST API
#
#   - bootstrapping a collection of objects which are
#     rendered in your markup on page load
#
#   - filtering with query string parameters against your API
#
#   - automatic interaction with your Luca.CollectionManager class
#
#   - make it easier to parse Rails style responses which include the root
#     by specifying a @root parameter
#
#   - use backbone-query if available
#
#   - onceLoaded: run a callback once if there are models present, otherwise wait until
#     the collection fetches
#
#   - ifLoaded: run a callback any time the model gets reset, or if there are already models
#

    # class, then we need to specify a key to register ourselves under. @registerAs can be
    # as simple as something as "books", or if you are using collections which need
    # to be scoped with some sort of unique id, as say some sort of belongsTo relationship

    # then you can set the collection to be a @memoryCollection
    # which never interacts with a persistence layer at all.

    # this is mainly used by the Luca.fields.SelectField class for
    # generating simple select fields with static data
